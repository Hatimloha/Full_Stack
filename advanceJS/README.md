# 🔥 Deep Dive JavaScript Roadmap

1. Core JS Deep Concepts
- Execution Context & Call Stack
- Hoisting, Scopes (Block, Function, Global)
- Closures (real-world uses: caching, currying, private variables)
- The this keyword & Binding
- Prototype & Inheritance
- Event Loop & Async JS (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await, Microtasks vs Macrotasks)
- Memory Management (Garbage Collection, Leaks)

2. Advanced JS Features
- ES6+ features (let/const, spread/rest, destructuring, template literals, modules, etc.)
- Symbols & Iterators
- Generators (sync & async)
- Proxies & Reflect API
- WeakMap, WeakSet
- Event Delegation

3. Functional Programming in JS
- Higher Order Functions
- Pure Functions & Immutability
- Map, Filter, Reduce deeply
- Currying & Partial Application
- Composition vs Inheritance

4. Object-Oriented JS
- Constructor Functions vs ES6 Classes
- Private/Public fields
- Getters & Setters
- Static Methods
- Mixins

5. Asynchronous & Concurrency
- Callbacks vs Promises vs Async/Await
- Promise.all, race, any
- Event Loop in detail
- Web APIs & Task Queue
- Workers (Web Workers, Service Workers)

6. Browser & DOM APIs
- DOM manipulation deeply
- Event Bubbling vs Capturing
- LocalStorage, SessionStorage, Cookies
- Fetch API & AJAX
- Intersection Observer, Mutation Observer
- Custom Events

7. Error Handling & Debugging
- Try, Catch, Finally
- Custom Errors
- Error objects
- Debugging tools (DevTools, breakpoints)

8. Performance Optimization
- Debounce & Throttle
- Memoization
- Lazy loading
- Code splitting
- Big-O in JS

9. Design Patterns in JS
- Singleton, Factory, Module, Observer, Proxy
- MVC, MVVM basics
- Event-driven patterns

10. Testing & Best Practices
- Writing unit tests (Jest/Mocha)
- Test-driven development basics
- Linting & Prettier
- Clean Code practices

11. Going Beyond
- Build your own Polyfills
- Implement a small JS runtime features (mini promise, bind, call, map, etc.)
- Create real-world projects (e.g., Todo app without framework, custom event emitter, throttled search)
