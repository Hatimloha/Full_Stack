# Theory:
> The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions — great when you have many exact values to check.

### Syntax
```js
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code block
    break;
  case value2:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block if no cases match
}
```
